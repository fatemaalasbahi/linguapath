# LinguaPath Cursor Development Guide

## Project Overview

You are helping build **LinguaPath**, an AI-powered language proficiency coaching platform.

LinguaPath helps students prepare for language proficiency exams by:

- Evaluating their current language ability
- Identifying weaknesses
- Generating personalized study plans
- Providing AI-powered feedback
- Tracking progress toward their goals

The MVP focuses on:

- Duolingo English Test (DET)
- HSK Chinese Proficiency Test

The platform should be designed so additional languages and exams can be added in the future.

---

# Course Alignment

This project should follow the TECHNEST AI Programming course approach.

The goal is to demonstrate:

- AI-assisted development using Cursor
- Full-stack application development
- Database integration
- Authentication
- AI-powered features
- Cloud deployment
- Professional software workflow

The project should follow the technologies and approaches taught in the course.

---

# Technology Stack

## Frontend

Use:

- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

The application must use the **Next.js App Router** (`src/app/`). Do not use the Pages Router.

---

## Deployment

Use:

- Vercel

---

## Database

Use:

- Neon PostgreSQL

---

## Database ORM

Use:

- Drizzle ORM

---

## Authentication

Use:

- Neon Auth

Authentication must support:

- User registration
- User login
- User sessions
- Protected user data

The application `users` table stores profile information and references the Neon Auth user ID. Passwords are **not** stored in the application database.

---

## AI Integration

Use:

- Gemini API

AI will power:

- Diagnostic assessments
- Writing evaluation
- Personalized study plans
- Learning recommendations

---

## Notifications

Use:

- Slack Webhook

The system should send notifications for:

- User feedback submissions
- Important application events

---

# Development Principles

## Build Incrementally

Do not build the entire application at once.

Development should happen in small, testable phases. Do not add features outside the MVP scope.

---

# Development Phases

Use this order:

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Phase 1 | Project setup |
| Phase 2 | Landing page |
| Phase 3 | Database setup (Neon + Drizzle) |
| Phase 4 | Authentication (Neon Auth) |
| Phase 5 | Dashboard + Exam Goals |
| Phase 6 | AI Diagnostic Assessment |
| Phase 7 | AI Study Plan Generation |
| Phase 8 | Practice Feedback + Progress Tracking |
| Phase 9 | Slack Notifications + Feedback System |
| Phase 10 | Deployment |

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup

Create:

- Next.js App Router application
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- GitHub connection

---

## Phase 2: Landing Page

Build:

- Public landing page
- Hero, problem, solution, features, and footer sections

---

## Phase 3: Database Setup

Implement:

- Neon PostgreSQL connection
- Drizzle ORM setup
- Database schema (see DATABASE_SCHEMA.md)

---

## Phase 4: Authentication

Implement:

- Neon Auth integration
- Protected routes
- User sessions
- Application `users` table linked to Neon Auth user ID

---

## Phase 5: Dashboard + Exam Goals

Build:

- User dashboard
- Exam selection
- Goal setting (score or level, depending on exam type)

---

## Phase 6: AI Diagnostic Assessment

Build:

- Diagnostic assessment flow
- Gemini integration for initial evaluation
- Store results in `assessments` table

---

## Phase 7: AI Study Plan Generation

Build:

- Personalized study plan generation
- Store plans in `study_plans` table

---

## Phase 8: Practice Feedback + Progress Tracking

Build:

- Writing practice submission flow
- AI feedback on practice responses
- Store submissions in `practice_submissions` table
- Progress tracking in `progress` table

---

## Phase 9: Slack Notifications + Feedback System

Build:

- Authenticated `/feedback` page with category, rating, and message fields
- User feedback form with loading, success, and error states
- Store feedback in `feedback` table (including `feedback_type` and `rating`)
- Slack webhook notifications using Block Kit formatting
- App sidebar navigation with Feedback link (desktop + mobile)
- Server-side Zod validation and rate limiting (5 successful submissions per user per 24 hours)

Environment:

- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` (server-only; never exposed to the browser)

Slack behavior:

- Notify after successful database save
- Slack failures are logged server-side but do not fail the user submission

---

## Phase 10: Deployment

Prepare:

- Environment variables
- Vercel deployment
- Final testing

---

# Before Making Changes

Before implementing any feature:

Explain:

1. What will be built
2. Why the feature is needed
3. Which files will change
4. Which dependencies are required

Wait for approval before major architectural changes.

---

# After Implementing Features

Explain:

1. What was changed
2. How the feature works
3. How to test it
4. Any possible issues

---

# Coding Rules

Follow these rules:

- Use TypeScript
- Write clean and reusable components
- Follow Next.js App Router best practices
- Keep components organized
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies
- Keep secrets in environment variables
- Never hardcode API keys
- Avoid unfinished features
- Prefer simple reliable solutions
- Do not add MVP features beyond the documented scope

---
